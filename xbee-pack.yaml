  The Apache HTTPD package contains an open-source HTTP server. It is useful for creating local intranet web sites or running huge web serving operations.

  Installed Programs: ab, apachectl, apxs, checkgid, dbmmanage, fcgistarter, htcacheclean, htdbm, htdigest, htpasswd, httpd, httxt2dbm, logresolve, and rotatelogs
  Installed Libraries: Several libraries under /usr/lib/httpd/modules/
  Installed Directories: /etc/httpd, {% documentRoot %}, /usr/include/httpd, /usr/lib/httpd, /usr/share/httpd, /var/log/httpd, and /var/run/httpd
  Short Descriptions
    ab: is a tool for benchmarking your Apache HTTP server
    apachectl: is a front end to the Apache HTTP server which is designed to help the administrator control the functioning of the Apache httpd daemon
    apxs: is a tool for building and installing extension modules for the Apache HTTP server
    checkgid: is a program that checks whether it can setgid to the group specified. This is to see if it is a valid group for Apache2 to use at runtime. If the user (should be run as superuser) is in that group, or can setgid to it, it will return 0
    dbmmanage: is used to create and update the DBM format files used to store usernames and passwords for basic authentication of HTTP users
    fcgistarter: is a tool to start a FastCGI program
    htcacheclean: is used to clean up the disk cache
    htdbm: is used to manipulate the DBM password databases
    htdigest: is used to create and update the flat-files used to store usernames, realms and passwords for digest authentication of HTTP users
    htpasswd: is used to create and update the flat-files used to store usernames and passwords for basic authentication of HTTP users
    httpd: is the Apache HTTP server program
    httxt2dbm: is used to generate DBM files from text, for use in RewriteMap
    logresolve: is a post-processing program to resolve IP-addresses in Apache's access log files
    rotatelogs: is a simple program for use in conjunction with Apache's piped log file feature
    suexec: allows users to run CGI and SSI applications as a different user
